Hello Allan/Reviewer, this is submisison for Module 1, To Do List application. It's pretty straightforward, 3 functions running is a while loop.
I challenged myself to make the task function caller (action varible) string based instead of interger based, then worked out when and how to revert those types to get the code to cooperate.
I wanted to have a task title and task description, i may refine this code on my own time as personl python project. 

enjoy my code, thanks!
